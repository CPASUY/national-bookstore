<br>
For this, a program was implemented where people could enter the library and could:
 1. Search the books you want, in addition to their code, review, chapter, cost, quantity
 2. Receive the most efficient way to pick up each book on its respective shelf so that the process is quick
 3. Collect the books in such a way that one is on top of another successively regardless of the order, for <br>
 this a basket is given so that you can put them in.
 4. Make a queue when making the payment where each client passes according to the order of arrival to the <br>
 available payment box that is.
